                    <p>I am currently a first year student of Computer Science at Queen Mary University London. I'm passionate about technology and currently focused on learning software development and web design and am also interested in Machine Learning Arfitical Intelligence. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in the software industry, where I can apply my skills to contribute to innovative projects.</p>

                        This webpage has been made using HTML and CSS! My first experience in web development has been extremely enjoyable and bein introduced to a very contrasting form of creativity compared to the other languages has been greatly enjoyable. As this webpage is developed there will be use of JavaScipt and PHP, and I look forward to updating this with my future experiences in my computer science journey along with the new skills I pick up in these languages.

                        I was able to learn my foundations in programming using Java through which I have been able to learn about Procedural and Object Oriented Programming. My first major project was a text-based football simulation game using the skills I picked up whilst learning Procedural Porgamming. I was able to go beyond the taught syllabus and explore what Java was able to accomplish as a language as well as some of its strngths and weaknesses. I am currently working on a Horse Racing simulator using Java which, along with the football simluator can be viewed on by GitHub.

                        Learning Git is essential to programming as it provides additional detail on how the program has been constructed which makes it easier to use either by yourself or by members of a team in the future. I have gotten into the habit of using Git for all my main projects and am still learning about the possibilities that Git provides while using it.
