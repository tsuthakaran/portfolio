                            This webpage has been my introduction into the world of web development.  It's been a refreshing change of pace to explore a new form of creativity which is so different from traditional programming languages.  While this site is built with HTML and CSS, I'm eager to integrate JavaScript and PHP in the very near future.  This portfolio will be a living document, reflecting my journey in computer science as I expand my skillset in these languages.

                            I established the fundamentals of programming with Java through Procedural and Object Oriented Programming. My first project was a text-based football simulation game, which I had found so engaging that I was able to venture beyond the conventional syllabus and incooporate more complex aspects of Java's capanilities whilst figuring out its strengths and weaknesses. With it being my first project without the use of any walkthrough materials, I was able to explore of the plethora of resources and was initiated to many programming communities online which I am excited to be a part of. I am currently working on a Horse Racing simulator using Java which, along with the football simluator can be viewed on by GitHub.

                            Mastering Git is fundamental in programming as it offers insight into how a program is constructed, facilitating ease of use for both individual developers and team collaboration. I've adopted Git as a standard practice for all my projects, continually exploring its functionalities to harness its full potential. Learning Git is essential to programming as it provides additional detail on how the program has been constructed which makes it easier to use either by yourself or by members of a team in the future. I have gotten into the habit of using Git for all my main projects and am still learning about the possibilities that Git provides while using it.

There is an underratedly high use of creativity, whether that be for creating a menu or coding a program, but both require many subsets to be described in great detailed then brought together so that it can easily be read and used. Using different platforms to update menus online is rather similar to using different programming languages, whilst most will share many key similiarities, there will be findamental differences between them which requires them to be used in very different ways in order to efficiently produce an outcome. Just like a program, a menu needs to be built from the ground up, with it never being quite complete, just ready for a new update further down the line, not dissimilar to a program itself. </li>
                        <li class="experience_description">Computer Science can be found in any sector of the world, and the efficiency and reliability of programs is essential for many, many different sectors. During my time in medical school, it was fascinating to see the extremely complex systems in place to store key information regarding patients and their treatment, as well as how it must not only be shared among different healthcare professionals with ease, but also must be secure in order to ensure that confidentiality rules were met. The different systems needed to be used by a range of different people, of all backgrounds and ages, meaning that it was essential for them to be accessible to all, and seeing the intricate ways of how this was accomplished, along with the amount of help it was able to provide staff and patients, showed me how a successful product needs to be designed, which is integral to the practice of Computer Science. </li>

There are full lists of players from all the top clubs in Europe and the simulation allows for a host of different storylines within the game, which I myself have spent a long time playing. This project started off as a coursework assignment but I ended up enjoying the basics of it so much that I continued to develop it to become a very enjoyable game. It is my first Java project and I was able to put into practice many of the core principles of Procedural Programing. <a id="enter_button" href="https://github.com/tsuthakaran/FANTASYFOOTBALL">View Project</a></figcaption>
